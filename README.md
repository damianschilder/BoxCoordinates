Of course. I have updated the README to include a new "Tips for Better Results" section with your latest advice. This will help users understand how to get more accurate results from your application.

Here is the updated README:

# Coordinates Extractor using SAM

A user-friendly desktop application that leverages Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to automatically identify objects in an image and extract their bounding box coordinates.

## About The Project

This tool was inspired by a researcher at Utrecht University who was manually selecting coordinates of fungi container lids in images. This manual process was a tedious but necessary step for her research, which involved scanning the containers at time intervals to measure the growth of the fungi by analyzing the grey values within the coordinates.

To automate this process, I developed this application. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the powerful Segment Anything Model, allowing users to load an image, tune filtering parameters, and instantly get machine-readable coordinates for detected objects. The application is designed to find and isolate specific objects (referred to as "lids" in the code) based on their size and shape.

What started as a simple script has now become a standalone desktop application with an installer to make it accessible to users who are not familiar with Python or command-line tools.

## Key Features

  * **SAM Integration:** Uses the high-performance `vit_b` variant of the Segment Anything Model for object segmentation.
  * **User-Friendly GUI:** A clean interface built with PySide6 that runs on Windows.
  * **Automatic Model Download:** If the required SAM model file (`.pth`) is not found, the application will prompt the user to download it automatically.
  * **Tunable Parameters:** Easily adjust filters for object size (min/max area) and aspect ratio to fine-tune detection.
  * **Visual Feedback:** Displays the original image annotated with segmentation masks and numbered bounding boxes for identified objects.
  * **Multiple Coordinate Formats:** Provides coordinates in a simple machine-readable list (`xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax`) and a detailed processing log.
  * **One-Click Copy:** Instantly copy the machine-readable coordinates to your clipboard.

## ðŸš€ Download

You can download the latest Windows executable from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName/releases/latest)**.

The application is a single `.exe` file that requires no installation.

## How to Use

1.  Download the `CoordinatesExtractor.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName/releases/latest).
2.  Run the executable. If you are running it for the first time, it will ask for permission to download the \~350MB model file required by SAM.
3.  Adjust the **Tuning Parameters** as needed:
      * **Num Lids Target:** The number of objects you expect to find.
      * **Min/Max Area Fraction:** Filters objects that are too small or too large relative to the image size.
      * **Min Aspect Ratio:** Filters objects based on their shape (1.0 is a perfect square).
4.  Click the **"Select Image & Process"** button and choose an image file.
5.  Wait for the processing to complete. The annotated image will appear on the left.
6.  The extracted coordinates will appear in the panels on the right. Use the "Copy" button to copy the simplified coordinates.
7.  To re-run the process on the same image with different parameters, adjust the values and click **"Retry with Current Params"**.

## Tips for Better Results

For the most accurate detection, tuning the parameters is key. Here are a couple of important tips:

  * **Set the Correct Number of Lids:** Ensure the **Num Lids Target** parameter matches the number of objects you expect to find in the image.
  * **Increase Points Per Side for Higher Accuracy:** The **SAM Pts/Side** parameter controls how detailed the model's analysis is. If the application is not identifying the lids correctly, try increasing this value to `50` or `90`. This will significantly improve the chances of correct identification, but be aware that it will also increase the processing time.

## Troubleshooting

  * **Model Download Fails:** If the application is unable to download the model file, try running the `CoordinatesExtractor.exe` as an administrator. The application may require elevated permissions to write the downloaded file to its directory.

## ðŸ”§ Building from Source

For developers who wish to modify or build the application themselves.

**Prerequisites:**

  * Python 3.9+
  * Git

**Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
    cd YourRepoName
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

      * First, install the PyTorch library that matches your system's CUDA version (or the CPU version). See the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the correct command. For example, for CPU:
        ```bash
        pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
        ```
      * Next, install the `segment-anything` library from its repository:
        ```bash
        pip install git+[https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git)
        ```
      * Finally, install the remaining packages:
        ```bash
        pip install PySide6 matplotlib numpy requests Pillow
        ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python BoxCoordinates.py
    ```

5.  **Build the executable:**
    Make sure PyInstaller is installed (`pip install pyinstaller`). Then, use the provided `.spec` file to build the executable.

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile CoordinatesExtractor.spec
    ```

    The final `.exe` will be in the `/dist` folder.
